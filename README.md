# Polyphonic Instrument tuning detection
In this project, we aimed to determine whether using audio embeddings from VGGish as a foundational model would improve our detection task. The goal was to develop a model capable of identifying which instrument in a group was out of tune. 
In the end, our best transfer learning model performed only slightly better than its baseline counterpart.
